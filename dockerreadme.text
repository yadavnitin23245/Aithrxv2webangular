 We have to create docker file in parent directory.
 add dockerignore file.
Add commands in docker file for copy and build.
add nginx.conf file in project if not added.
go to cmd of parent directory of the project.
for creating images execute command > docker build -t av-aithrangular-image .
for ceratinig container execute  > docker run --name av-av-aithrangular-image-container -d -p 8081:80 av-aithrangular-image
you change the port if needed.
Go to desktop docker and you can check your image and container and also test your image by running in browser.
